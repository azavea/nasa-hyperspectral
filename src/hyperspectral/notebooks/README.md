# Example Jupyter Notebooks

This directory contains a collection of notebooks that demonstrate the capabilities of the `hyperspectral` package.

## Data Requirements

The `ECOSTRESS` directory needs to be populated by data downloadable from [this website](https://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov/download).  That will require making a request and enduring a short waiting period.  When available, unpack the ECOSTRESS library into the `ECOSTRESS` folder.

Some additional spectral and/or raster data may be needed for individual notebooks.  Instructions for downloading those ancillary data will be contained in the pertinent notebooks.
