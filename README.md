- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [Scripts](#scripts)

## Requirements

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) 19.03+
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 1.27+

## Getting Started

The following script will provision the development environment.

```bash
$ ./scripts/setup
```

Then, you can bring up the local Franklin instance, which will be accessible at
http://localhost:9090.


```bash
$ ./scripts/server
```

See READMEs in the `src/` directories for instructions on how to run individual
services in this application.
