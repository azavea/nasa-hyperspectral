This directory and its subdirectories contain code for training machine learning models for two use cases and code for using those models.
The two use cases are detecting algal blooms in hyperspectral imagery and detecting red-stage (versus green-stage) conifers in a particular part of California.
Much of the code found here is experimental and is preserved for purposes of completeness, but the tree health code and models might be somewhat useful.
